"The developer of Dex (Moon, which he skidded the whole thing basically) has talked about a "judgement day". I assume he wants to change the dex model and insert malicious code, which he has spread before. I would advise everyone that has Dex in their script hubs/exploits to make a copy for yourself and reuploading the dex gui so he cant change anything."

**This version of Infinite Yield contains legitimate and safe loadstrings instead of the alternative ones Infinite Yield uses. For an example, it uses Dark Dex V3 Secured by Hamsta instead of Moon's Dex. It also removed the updater system.**
